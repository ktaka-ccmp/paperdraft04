Linux container technology and clusters of the containers are expected to make web services that consist of multiple web servers and a load balancer portable, and thus realize easy migration of web services.
This prevents a service to be locked-in a single cloud provider or single location.
However existing container management systems lack the generic implementation to route the traffic from the internet into the web service consisting of container clusters.
For example, Kubernetes, which is one of the most popular container management system, is heavily dependent on cloud load balancers and if users use unsupported cloud providers or on-premise datacenters, it is up to users to route the traffic into their cluster while keeping the redanduncy and scailability.
This means that users could easily be locked-in the major cloud providers including GCP, AWS and Azure.
In this paper we propose an architecture with a group of containerized load balancers and ECMP redundancy for Kubernets.
We containerize Linux IPVS and exabgp, and implement experimental system using standard Linux boxes and open source softwares.
We also reveal that our proposed system function as we intended.
Our proposed load balancers are usable even if a infrastructure does not have supported load balancers by Kubernetes and thus free users from lock-ins.
